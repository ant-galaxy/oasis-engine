The physics engine is a crucial component of game engines, primarily responsible for the following functions:
- Physical collision detection
- Rigid body dynamics simulation  
- Joint constraint system
- Physics event response

To meet the needs of different application scenarios, Galacean adopts a multi-backend design:

- **Lite**: Optimized for simple interaction scenarios, lightweight
- **PhysX**: Provides complete physics features based on PhysX physics engine

Both backends implement a unified [Physics System API](https://github.com/galacean/engine/tree/main/packages/design/src/physics), allowing developers to flexibly choose based on project requirements. For detailed design specifications of the physics system, please refer to the [Design Document](https://github.com/galacean/engine/wiki/Physical-system-design).

<Callout type="info">
For scenarios requiring physics components or Raycast picking like `InputManager`, the physics engine needs to be initialized before use.
</Callout>

Currently, Galacean Engine provides two built-in physics engine backend implementations:

1. [Lite](/apis/physics-lite)([physics-lite](https://github.com/galacean/engine/tree/main/packages/physics-lite))
   - Lightweight physics engine implementation
   - Only supports basic collision detection
   - Suitable for simple interaction scenarios

2. [PhysX](/apis/physics-physx)([physics-physx](https://github.com/galacean/engine/tree/main/packages/physics-physx))
   - Based on PhysX physics engine, compiled through WebAssembly
   - Supports advanced physics features and accurate simulation
   - Suitable for complex physical interaction scenarios

## Choosing a Physics Backend

When choosing a physics backend, three factors need to be considered: functionality, performance, and package size:

### 1. Feature Support

| Feature | physics-lite | physics-physx |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Collision Detection | ✓ | ✓ |
| Physics Effects and Feedback | × | ✓ |
| Continuous Collision Detection | × | ✓ |
| Joint System | × | ✓ |

### 2. Performance
- **PhysX**: 
  - Best performance on WebAssembly platform
  - Automatically falls back to JavaScript implementation
  - Built-in scene acceleration structure
  
- **Lite**: 
  - Lightweight implementation, low performance overhead
  - Suitable for simple scenarios

### 3. Package Size
- **PhysX**: About 2.5MB (wasm/js)
- **Lite**: Lightweight, almost no additional overhead

## Usage

### Configuration in Editor

Developers can set the physics backend in the **Project Settings** panel accessed through the [Main Menu](/docs/interface/menu).

![Select Physics Engine](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_3zduhr/afts/img/A*ZvWdQqEfIKoAAAAAAAAAAAAADsJ_AQ/original)

### Script Usage

When initializing the engine through scripts, simply pass the physics backend object to the `Engine`:

#### Using Lite Physics Engine
```typescript
import { WebGLEngine } from "@galacean/engine-rhi-webgl";
import { LitePhysics } from "@galacean/engine-physics-lite";

const engine = await WebGLEngine.create({ canvas: "canvas" });
engine.physicsManager.initialize(LitePhysics);
```

#### Using PhysX Physics Engine
```typescript
import { WebGLEngine } from "@galacean/engine-rhi-webgl";
import { PhysXPhysics } from "@galacean/engine-physics-physx";

const engine = await WebGLEngine.create({ canvas: "canvas" });
await engine.physicsManager.initialize(PhysXPhysics);
```
