Physical colliders are composed of basic physical shapes, including spheres, boxes, capsules, and infinite planes. In practical applications, these collider shapes rarely align perfectly with the rendered objects, which creates significant challenges for visual debugging.
There are two debugging methods:
1. Using PhysX Visual Debugger (PVD), which is NVIDIA's official debugging tool. However, using this tool requires compiling a debug version of PhysX and connecting the browser to the debugging tool via WebSocket.
For specific usage instructions, please refer to the introduction in the Readme of [physx.js](https://github.com/galacean/physX.js).
2. We also provide a lightweight [auxiliary lines tool](https://github.com/galacean/engine-toolkit/tree/main/packages/auxiliary-lines), which draws wireframes according to the physics component configuration to assist in configuring and debugging physics components.
It's very easy to use - just mount the `WireframeManager` script and set its association with various physics components, or directly associate it with nodes:
```typescript
const wireframe = rootEntity.addComponent(WireframeManager);
wireframe.addCollideWireframe(collider);
```
